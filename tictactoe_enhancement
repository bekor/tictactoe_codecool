Step 1

    Player can choose One player (play against AI) or Two players mode.
    The game always starts with player X.
    Two function is defined for handling inputs.
    One for define the board row the other the column.
    At every steps the program reprint the board.
    The AI is not too smart :(, just putting O at random position.
    When someone won/ or the game concluded to draw, the game exits.

Step 2:

    - Defining a function which creating the board according to the input size parameter.
    - Redefining the coordinates of the board: row as alphabets and column as numbers.
    - Redefining get_row_input/get_column_input functions to one function.
    - Defining a function with two choice: replay or exit game.
    - Handling escape shortcut.
    - Separating program parts to other files.
    
    Optional:
	- Developing AI.
